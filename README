Scalar-Andand

Scalar::andand lets us write:

 $phone = Location->find(:first, name => 'Johnson' )->andand->phone

And get a guarded method invocation or safe navigation method. This snippet performs a ->find on the Location class, then sends .phone to the result if the result is defined. If the result is not defined, then the expression returns false without throwing an exception. 

This module contains more magic than what is responsible, don't be surprised by weird bugs. I've warned you!
